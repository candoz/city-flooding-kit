# City Flooding Kit

This project lies in the context of the smart environment, regarding prevention and **warning systems** for environmental disasters concerning, in particular, river flooding.  

The goal of our work is to provide a configurable kit for hypothetical public authorities, to effectively monitor the critical conditions that precede an emergency situation.
